          <p data-aos="fade-up">More than two years ago I started the study of ICT & Media Design at the Fontys
          university of applied
          sciences in Eindhoven. During the first semester I learned the basics of ICT including in C# and of course
          HTML5/CSS3. I really struggled during this semester because I had no background in programming whatsoever,
          luckily during the second period it struck me how OOP programming works and I finished programming with a
          7/10.</p>

        <h2>Semester 2 - Branding experience</h2>
        <h6>February 2017 - June 2017</h6>
        <p>During my second semester I actually started with the course Media Design. Here I started
        working with PHP and
        basic JS. I also started with user centered design, concepting and media strategies. Our group assignment was
        focused working on the complete branding of an artist of the rock academy in Tilburg. I finished this
        semester
        with flying colors with an average 7/10.</p>

        <h2>De Vooruitgang</h2>
        <h6>March 2017</h6>
        <p>After moving to Eindhoven, I quickly found a job at a beautiful bar at the main square.
        Itâ€™s one of the biggest bars in the city with 330+ seats and place for 500-600 people during Friday- and
        Saturday nights. After a few months working as a server I promoted to become a bartender which I love, at
        this
        time I promoted to head bartender, this means guiding 10+ bartenders through the evening, communicating with
        management and security and making/keeping our guests happy. <br>
          On the side I also do some print design to help push De Vooruitgang forward.

        <h2>Semester 3 - Trial and error</h2>
        <h6>September 2017 - January 2018</h6>
        <p>During my third semester I focused the first two months on building fully fucntional webapp for BWventures
        build in PHP, my main focus was on the front so that means a lot of LESS and vanillaJS. After these two
        months passed I was given the chance to work on my own projects. I did some UI-design, branding and I got
        into contact with React and Firebase for the first time.
